## Blender Texture Bake & FBX Export Script

This script automates texture baking (Base Color only via EMIT) and FBX export for selected mesh objects in Blender 4.4+.  
It generates low-resolution (e.g. 512x512) baked PNG textures, replaces materials with simplified versions, and exports optimized FBX files with embedded textures.

✔️ Ideal for game asset optimization (e.g. Unity / mobile use).  
✔️ Automatically unwraps UVs if missing.  
✔️ Outputs to an "Export" folder next to the .blend file.
