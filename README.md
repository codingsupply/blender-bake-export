# blender-bake-export
Blender 4.4 script for automatically baking Base Color textures (Emit only) and exporting each selected mesh as an FBX with embedded, low-res baked texture. Includes automatic UV generation, material setup, and optimized output for real-time use (e.g., Unity). Output goes to an "Export" folder next to the .blend file.
